classdef SquareTensorPatch < diffgeometry.TensorPatch & diffgeometry.SquareMatPatch
    % A tensor that is also a square matrix, i.e. something whose
    % components transform as a tensor but of which we can take determinant
    % and trace etc. E.g. metric or second fundamental form (curvature) L

            % The second is for subclasses to have a contructor with the
            % same syntax, copying additional properties from the argument
            % map. Because Map.compose will call the constructor of any
            % subclass with the same arguments.
